[ AE FOR CREDIT ]

- Make sure that your gif and all other cell outputs are present in your notebook!

- Confirm that the digits are able to be reconstructed in the bottleneck
   - Make a few notes below talking about whether or not this is interesting and/or useful.

The result that we recieve is great! It shows us that our autoencoder was able to take our inputs and learn how to reconstruct them. We can use this technology to teach a model to recreate and denoise noisy or blurry images. We can see our resulting images have slightly less noise than our inputs.

- Confirm that the latent encoding's decomposition roughly matches with original data's.
   - Comment a bit on it. Is this a good sign? Does it have any use?

As the images below are roughly the same we know that before and after encoding and decoding the data is roughly the same. That means that our autoencoder is working successfully.



[ VAE FOR CREDIT ]

- Make sure both of your gifs are present in the notebook!

- Talk about a potential application that you think it would be cool to applied VAEs to.

Using latent space VAEs we are able to create music. We can input differnt baselines and modelodies and create new songs. Cite below.

[ GAN FOR CREDIT | BONUS ]

- Make sure that your gif and all other cell outputs are present in your notebook!

- Discuss a bit about the pros and cons of using a GAN in this context. 

- For 2470 students, the above will give you half of the bonus points. The other half can be obtained by trying out the WGAN-GP model below.
